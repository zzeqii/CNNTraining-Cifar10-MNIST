## folder description
In this folder, we have 2 sub-folders “algorithm” and “input_data”.
In sub-folder “input_data”, we should firstly put our dataset “mnist_dataset.npz”and “cifar_dataset.npz” there.
In another sub-folder “algorithm”, we have 2 jupyter notebook files here which are importance reweighting method on MNIST, CIFAR data and correct loss method on MNIST, CIFAR data. After running a notebook file, we can get 10 accuracies and losses on test data.

## How to run

Our code written in Python3

The code rely on some extend libraries shown below:
numpy
pandas
keras
tensorflow
sklearn

you can easily open the jupyter notebook file and run the code directly
